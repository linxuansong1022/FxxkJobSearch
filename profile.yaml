experiences:
  - company: "Dalian Maritime University AI Application Research Center"
    role: "Research Intern"
    dates: "Feb. -- Jun. 2025"
    location: "Dalian, China"
    bullets:
      - "Developed a transfer learning framework for Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), adapting generative models for downstream tasks by freezing backbones and fine-tuning task-specific heads."
      - "Improved image classification accuracy by 4.06% over a ViT baseline on small-scale datasets by integrating DDPM with diverse classification heads."
      - "Engineered a 1D regression model for ocean wave height prediction, reducing MSE by 54.4% vs. baseline and 21.2% vs. a 3-layer MLP through diffusion-based feature extraction."
      - "Optimized data efficiency by identifying optimal transfer conditions (mid-layer blocks and noise levels), validating diffusion models as robust, general-purpose feature extractors."

projects:
  - name: "Intellectual Chinese Culinary GraphRAG System"
    role: "Lead Developer"
    type: "Personal Project"
    dates: "Oct. 2024 -- Present"
    bullets:
      - "Developed a Graph-enhanced RAG system to overcome the limitations of standard vector-only RAG in handling complex multi-hop reasoning and maintaining global context within large-scale culinary datasets."
      - "Engineered a hybrid retrieval architecture combining Neo4j knowledge graphs with Milvus vector stores to achieve high-precision semantic search and structural relationship discovery."
      - "Built a high-fidelity knowledge graph in Neo4j (Recipes, Ingredients, Categories) and implemented a Poly-key Inverted Index strategy, utilizing LLM-based key expansion to map complex relations (REQUIRES, HAS_STEP)."
      - "Deployed Milvus Lite with HNSW indexing and BGE-small-zh embeddings; designed a Pre-filtering Hybrid Search pipeline to combine vector similarity with structured metadata (Cuisine, Difficulty)."
      - "Achieved a significant reduction in LLM hallucination for relationship-heavy queries and improved retrieval recall by approximately 35% compared to baseline FAISS/Chroma search implementations."

  - name: "Ship Fire Detection System"
    role: "Project Leader"
    type: "Competition"
    dates: "May -- Aug. 2023"
    location: "Nanjing, China"
    bullets:
      - "Spearheaded the development of a real-time fire detection system powered by STM32, integrating smoke and temperature sensors for data collection and processing."
      - "Optimized the MobileNet V2 neural network on STM32, achieving a 35% reduction in power consumption while maintaining 20ms inference time, 10 FPS, and 91% quantized accuracy for reliable edge computing performance."
      - "Designed and implemented a versatile Qt-based upper-computer interface for comprehensive sensor data monitoring (MQ-2, DHT11, OV7670), control, and management, achieving sub-1s latency and 99% sensor data accuracy."
      - "Developed a robust logging and recovery mechanism, capable of processing up to 500 records per second and achieving a 95% recovery rate through automatic reconnection."
